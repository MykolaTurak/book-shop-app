## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

To run BookStore locally, you can use **Docker Compose** ‚Äì the easiest way to automatically configure both the app and the database.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MykolaTurak/book-shop-app.git # Replace with your repo
cd BookStore
```

### 3. Run the App with Docker Compose

Navigate to the project root directory (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located) and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

* Build a Docker image for your app based on the `Dockerfile`.
* Start a **MySQL** container (if not already running).
* Start a container for your **BookStore** app.
* Automatically run Liquibase migrations at startup.

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
API docs (Swagger UI) will be available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

### 4. Stopping the App

To stop the running containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, then run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
